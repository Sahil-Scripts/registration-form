# Online Registration App


## Local testing (quick)
1. Install a local PHP server: [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) or [MAMP] or use PHP built-in server.
2. Place the `online-registration-app` folder in your web root (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
3. Start Apache + (MySQL not required for this simple app).
4. Visit: `http://localhost/online-registration-app/index.html` and submit the form — you'll see the formatted display generated by `process.php`.


### Or using PHP built-in server
From the project folder run:



Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html`.


## Hosting options (quick pick for students)


### Option A — 000webhost / InfinityFree (free, simple)
- Good if you want quick free PHP + MySQL hosting with a subdomain.
- Steps:
1. Create account on 000webhost.com or infinityfree.net.
2. Create a new site and note FTP credentials or use their file manager.
3. Upload all project files into `public_html` (or the web root) via FTP (FileZilla) or control panel upload.
4. Open the provided subdomain and test `index.html`.


### Option B — Render (academic/developer friendly)
- Render supports PHP (including Laravel) and Git-based deploys; better for production-like workflow.
- Steps:
1. Push your project to GitHub.
2. Sign up at render.com and create a new Web Service.
3. Link your GitHub repo, set build commands if needed (or use a Dockerfile), and deploy.


### Option C — Tiiny.host or other instant PHP hosts
- If you need a one-click instant deploy for a few PHP files, Tiiny.host can host instantly.


## Security & next steps
- This sample uses basic `htmlspecialchars()` sanitation. For real use:
- Validate inputs server-side (email format, required fields).
- Use CSRF tokens for form protection.
- Use prepared statements and parameterized queries if you add DB storage.
- Use HTTPS and secure hosting.
